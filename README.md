WHAT ARE THESE ALGORITHMS ?

ðŸ –Sorting : A Sorting Algorithm is used to rearrange a given array or list elements according to a comparison operator on the elements.

ðŸ –Searching : The searching algorithms are used to search or find one or more than one element from a dataset. 

ðŸ –B-tree : A B-tree is a tree data structure that keeps data sorted and allows searches, insertions, and deletions in logarithmic amortized time.

ðŸ –RBtree : A red-black tree is a binary search tree which has some red-black properties.

ðŸ –Fibonacci Heap : A Fibonacci heap is a data structure for priority queue operations, consisting of a collection of heap-ordered trees. 

ðŸ –Binomial Heap : Binomial Heap: A Binomial Heap is a set of Binomial Trees where each Binomial Tree follows Min Heap property.

ðŸ –Prim's : Prim's algorithm (also known as JarnÃ­k's algorithm) is a greedy algorithm that finds a minimum spanning tree for a weighted undirected graph.

ðŸ –Kruskal : Kruskal's algorithm is a greedy algorithm a minimum spanning forest of an undirected edge-weighted graph.

ðŸ –Dijkistra : Dijkstra's algorithm is an algorithm for finding the shortest paths between nodes in a graph.

ðŸ –Bellman Ford : The Bellman-Ford algorithm is an example of Dynamic Programming. 

ðŸ –Floyd Warshal : Floyd Warshall Algorithm is a famous algorithm. It is used to solve All Pairs Shortest Path Problem ,example of dynamic programming approach.

ðŸ –Back tracking : It is known as Depth First Search used for solving decision problems.

ðŸ –Branch and Bound : It is known as Breadth First Search and used for solving Optimization problem.

ðŸ –Randomization : It is an algorithm that takes random numbers to find the solution to the problem.

ðŸ –Approximation :  An approximation algorithm is a way of dealing with NP-completeness for an optimization problem. 

ðŸ –Huffman Coding : Huffman coding is a lossless data compression algorithm.
